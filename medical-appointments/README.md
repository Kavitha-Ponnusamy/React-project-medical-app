This repository contains the front-end application for the "Medical Appointments" capstone project.
The front-end provides an intuitive user interface for interacting with the booking system.
Users can log in with a username, browse a list of doctors, view detailed information about specific doctors, reserve appointments, add new doctors, and manage existing doctors.
